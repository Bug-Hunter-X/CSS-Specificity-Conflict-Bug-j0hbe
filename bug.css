The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a specificity conflict causes unexpected styling:

```css
#container {
  color: blue;
}

.element {
  color: red;
}

#container .element {
  color: green; /* This style is not applied due to specificity conflict */
}

```

The intended behavior is for `.element` within `#container` to have a green color. However, due to the higher specificity of the `#container` rule, the blue color is applied instead.
